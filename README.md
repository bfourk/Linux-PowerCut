# Linux-PowerCut
A reimplimentation of [v3x4](https://github.com/freecableguy/v3x4)'s VCCIN/PowerCut feature for Linux; similar to ThrottleStop's PowerCut.

Tested on a Dell Precision M4800 (i7-4900mq)

## Requirements:
* Haswell CPU (I believe this only works on certain chips, but it's worth trying)
* MSR Kernel Module
* Python3
* Root
